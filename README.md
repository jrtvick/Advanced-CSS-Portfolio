# Advanced-CSS-Portfolio


## Description

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate advanced CSS use. CSS gives a webpage much more detail and interactivity, and this exercise helped show just how much was taught in week one of the bootcamp. The reason for building this webpage is to show my knowledge and ability with CSS as well as establish a portfolio for future when presenting my work to colleagues and potential employers. Understanding things like how button tags can add further details to elements and how media queries work will streamline the process of producing interactive and well functioning sites in the future. I learned how to do numerous advanced CSS stylings, as well as furthered my knowledge of how to make HTML and CSS work together to style a webpage.
